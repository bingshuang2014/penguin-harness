## Why PenguinHarness

> With LangChain, you build agents by hand — at 1× speed.<br />With PenguinHarness, agents build agents — at 100×.

Three reasons, in deliberate order — from task quality, to how agents get built, to how they keep improving.

### 1. 🏆 Outstanding results at tens of times less cost

A deliberately minimal toolset over clean low-level interfaces: fewer tool calls, fewer tokens — deeply tuned for open models like DeepSeek. Each harness on the model it is normally paired with, same tasks, head-to-head:

<p align="center">

    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/readme/benchmark-dark.svg" />
    <img src="assets/readme/benchmark-light.svg" alt="Benchmark: PenguinHarness leads the data-analysis suite and ties OpenAI Codex on coding, at a small fraction of both rivals' cost" width="920" />
  </picture>
</p>

**Best accuracy on data analysis — at 1/70 of Claude Code's cost.**

### 2. ⚡ One sentence, and an agent builds your agent app

Type one sentence, and an agent builds the complete agent application for you — scaffold, code, and run instructions, end to end:

```text
Collect the docs from https://github.com/ericbuess/claude-code-docs and build a RAG app that answers Claude Code questions as a configuration expert, citing its sources.
```

And this is the finished product — a docs expert with retrieval, cited sources that link to the original files, and example questions built in:

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b7033e8-f08a-4c3f-bd33-547896664e6e

**And generating this entire RAG app burned just $0.02 (¥0.2) of tokens — on DeepSeek V4 Pro.**

### 3. 🧬 Self-evolution: it gets stronger with use

With PenguinHarness Skills, an agent evaluates and optimizes itself: run the benchmark, find the lost points, ship version N+1 — with a snapshot before every round, and every request observable in the Trace view.

## Built-in Skills

Four Skill groups ship in the box ([docs](https://penguin.ooo/docs/skills)); agents can also write and optimize their own:

| Group                | Skills                                                                            |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Office Productivity  | `data-analysis`, `firecrawl`                                                      |
| Software Development | `web-design`, `software-engineering`                                              |
| AI App Development   | `penguin-sdk`, `penguin-cli`, `agenthub-models`, `vllm`, `ollama`, `llamafactory` |
| Agent Tuning         | `agent-creation`, `benchmark-design`, `agent-evaluation`, `agent-optimization`    |

Each family's latest generation only — the app's **Models** page lists every built-in preset, and any OpenAI-protocol endpoint works too: pick a preset, or point a custom endpoint at any of the 1000+ online and local models.

## Requirements

| Requirement  | Supported                                                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OS           | Linux, macOS, Windows 10+                                                  |
| Architecture | x64, arm64                                                                 |
| Runtime      | bundled by the one-line installer (npm installs need Node >= 24)           |
| Model        | an API key for at least one model                                          |

## Installation

Two ways in — both work on the same `~/.penguin/data` root, so a desktop install and a CLI install can be mixed freely:

- **🖥️ Desktop app** — a double-click install: it embeds the server and opens already signed in, no terminal involved.
- **⌨️ CLI** — a one-line installer (or npm / offline package) puts the `penguin` command on the machine; `penguin web` then serves the full Web experience in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:7364` (multi-session chat, agent / skill / model management, usage stats, Trace observability, evaluation center). The online installers bundle their own Node runtime — unpack and run; upgrades and reinstalls never touch your data.

> [!NOTE]
> On a CLI install, the first Web login is `admin`, with the initial password (of the form `penguin-1234`) printed as a framed notice on every server start until it is changed — change it right after. Models are configured on the in-app **Models** page.

### 🖥️ Desktop app

The full Web experience as a standalone application: it embeds the server and opens already signed in — no terminal, no login page, no initial password to copy. It works on the same `~/.penguin/data` root as a CLI install, so the two can be used interchangeably (a data root only ever runs one server; if a CLI-started instance is already up, the app attaches to it).

**[⬇️ Get it from the download page](https://penguin.ooo/download)** — the page serves the OSS-accelerated mirror when it is reachable, and every installer is also attached to each [GitHub Release](https://github.com/Prism-Shadow/penguin-harness/releases).

| Platform    | Installers                  |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| macOS 11+   | dmg (Apple Silicon / Intel) |
| Windows 10+ | installer (.exe, x64)       |
| Linux (x64) | AppImage / deb              |

Current builds are unsigned, so the system may block the very first launch. Expand your platform for the one-time fix:

<details>
<summary><b>🍎 macOS says “PenguinHarness” is damaged and can’t be opened</b></summary>

macOS quarantines files downloaded from the internet, and the missing signature makes that flag surface as a false “damaged” alert. Deleting the flag clears it:

1. Open the downloaded dmg and drag `PenguinHarness.app` into the **Applications** folder.
2. Open **Terminal** (Launchpad → Other → Terminal).
3. Paste this command into Terminal and press Enter, then type your login password (nothing shows while you type; press Enter when done):

   ```bash
   sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/PenguinHarness.app
   ```

4. Once it finishes, double-click the app — it now opens normally.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🪟 Windows SmartScreen says “Windows protected your PC”</b></summary>

The installer is not signed yet, so SmartScreen holds the first run: click **More info**, then **Run anyway** to continue installing — first run only.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🐧 Linux: double-clicking the AppImage does nothing</b></summary>

Browsers download AppImages without the execute permission. Grant it once and the app starts normally from then on (the deb package installs through the package manager and is not affected):

```bash
chmod +x penguin-desktop-linux-x86_64.AppImage
```

</details>

### 🐧🍎 Linux / macOS (online install)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://penguin.ooo/install.sh | sh
penguin web        # start the service and open http://127.0.0.1:7364
```

### 🪟 Windows (online install, PowerShell)

```powershell
irm https://penguin.ooo/install.ps1 | iex
penguin web        # start the service and open http://127.0.0.1:7364
```

### 📦 npm (any platform, Node >= 24)

```bash
npm install -g @prismshadow/penguin-cli
penguin web        # start the service and open http://127.0.0.1:7364
```

<details>
<summary><b>📴 Offline install (air-gapped machines)</b></summary>

Every <a href="https://github.com/Prism-Shadow/penguin-harness/releases">GitHub Release</a> attaches exactly one package per target — Linux and macOS in x64 / arm64, Windows in x64, plus a runtime-less universal package — and the same file serves online and offline installation. Each package seals the program payload, its SHA256 checksum and the platform's installer: download the one file on a networked machine, copy it to the target, extract once and run the bundled installer — no network, no separate checksum file to carry (the sealed SHA256 is always verified).

**Linux (on arm64, use `penguin-linux-arm64.tar.gz`):**

```bash
mkdir penguin-install
tar -xzf penguin-linux-x64.tar.gz -C penguin-install
./penguin-install/install.sh
```

**macOS (Apple silicon shown; on Intel, use `penguin-darwin-x64.tar.gz`):**

```bash
mkdir penguin-install
tar -xzf penguin-darwin-arm64.tar.gz -C penguin-install
./penguin-install/install.sh
```

**Windows (unzip, then double-click `install.cmd` — or run it in PowerShell):**

```powershell
Expand-Archive penguin-win32-x64.zip -DestinationPath penguin-install
cd penguin-install
.\install.cmd
```

</details>

### 🤖 CLI & SDK — for agents

The same engine, scriptable — made to be driven by agents (and agents building agents):

```bash
penguin config model add --provider deepseek --model-id deepseek-v4-flash --api-key sk-... --set-default
penguin run -m "Create hello.txt containing Hello, Penguin"   # one-shot task
penguin chat       # interactive REPL (/compact, /exit, Ctrl-C to interrupt)
penguin server     # headless service (same API the Web App uses)
```

```ts
import { createAgent, isCompleteModelMessage, userText } from "@prismshadow/penguin-core";

const agent = await createAgent({ agentId: "default_agent" });
const session = await agent.createSession({ workspaceDir: process.cwd() });

for await (const output of session.run([userText("Create hello.txt containing hi")], {
  approve: async () => "allow", // per-tool-call approval
})) {
  if (isCompleteModelMessage(output) && output.payload.type === "text") {
    console.log(output.payload.text);
  }
}
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Public release of the benchmark suite
- [x] Desktop app
- [x] Windows support
- [ ] Agent company and templates
- [ ] Company-level self evolving
- [ ] OpenShell integration (permission-governed shell)
- More to come…

## Development

```bash
pnpm install && pnpm build   # build first: core's exports point at dist/
pnpm dev                     # backend + web app together (prefixed logs, deps built once)
```
