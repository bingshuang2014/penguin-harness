/**
 * context_engine — orchestrates the ReAct loop.
 *
 * context_engine only handles OmniMessage, orchestrating the flow of events between the
 * Human, LLM, and Environment interfaces, and writes every observable action to Trace.
 * The initial version keeps a linear message history.
 *
 * Human is the SDK's input/output boundary: there is no "Human implementation/interface".
 * Input is the Prompt list passed to `run`, plus the abort signal `signal` and the
 * per-tool approval callback `approve` in `RunOptions`; output is the OmniMessage stream
 * produced by `run`.
 *
 * Docs: packages/docs/content/agent-loop.{zh,en}.md (site path /docs/agent-loop) documents
 * the turn lifecycle, carry-over, reconnect and compaction implemented here.
 *
 * Approval is an **in-turn interaction** and tool calls are **async/incremental** (see
 * comment #24):
 *   - A single `run` call automatically runs the entire ReAct loop (no more resuming in batches);
 *   - Each tool_call is emitted as soon as its stream completes → `await approve` → if
 *     allowed, it runs via Environment;
 *   - Execution **does not block** continued consumption of the LLM stream or approval of
 *     the next tool (executions can overlap), but approvals still happen one at a time;
 *   - partial/complete `tool_call_output` is yielded in **completion order**;
 *   - once all tool outputs for the turn are ready, they become the next turn's LLM input;
 *     the Task ends once a turn produces no more tool_call.
 *
 * Implementation note: an internal queue merges "the LLM event stream + N concurrent tool
 * output streams" into a single yield sequence. GenerativeModel is a stateful object
 * (AgentHub maintains the history); each turn the engine only hands it the "new" messages:
 * the user Prompt on the first turn, and the previous turn's tool_call_output afterward.

  /**
   * `summarize` compaction: appends the compaction Prompt to the **old** LLM object (first
   * folding in all of this turn's tool results when mid-Task, to keep tool_use/tool_result
   * pairing), then extracts the `[summary]` and wraps it as `[context_summary]` user text. The
   * compaction request carries the session's toolset **unchanged** — the request prefix must
   * stay byte-identical to ordinary turns so the provider's prompt cache remains valid;
   * compaction runs exactly when the context is largest, where re-billing the whole
   * transcript uncached costs tens of times more (issue #84 — this is why tools are *not*
   * omitted and no `tool_choice` override is used). The
   * compaction request's streamed output is not pushed to the Human output stream (it emits
   * paired compaction events, plus every attempt's `token_usage` — positioned between the two
   * events, so the frontend stats and the server's usage records count the compaction's true
   * spend, rejected attempts included), but it is written
   * to the old Trace. Compaction succeeds only with a **valid summary** — non-empty extracted
   * text and no tool calls in the response. Everything short of that is one kind of failure,
   * handled exactly like an ordinary LLM request's (issue #170): an unusable committed
   * response (empty summary, or tool calls — answered with synthesized failed outputs and
   * retried behind a corrective note, see the loop body) and the transport failures
   * (failed/timeout/malformed) all reconnect under the one `compactionMaxReconnects` budget
   * (defaulting to the turn loop's budget and ladder — see RETRY_STATUSES); only `auth` stops
   * without retrying. Once the budget is exhausted the compaction fails; on failure/abort, the original
   * context and Trace index are kept — it does not fall back to discard. The first **committed**
   * attempt absorbs `pendingToolOutputs` into the old context's history (issue #85): later
   * resends carry only the repairs and the Prompt, and the result's `committed` flag tells
   * the caller the folded input must not be resent even though the compaction did not complete.
